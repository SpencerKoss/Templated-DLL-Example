# Templated-DLL-Example
This program DLL uses templates in order to use different data types. 
In my example in main it uses integers, however it can handle different types of data as well. 
This DLL shows an example of operator overloading, inserting data at the front, and back of the list, reversing the list, 
finding a particular datum in the list, unlinking the desired datum, and removing said desired datum, and finally clearing the DLL
